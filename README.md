# Business Process Modeling and Causal Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of algorithms for the extraction and analysis of business process models. The primary techniques utilized include the Alpha algorithm for process modeling and a causality analysis method to uncover causal relationships within these models.

## Algorithms Used

### Alpha Algorithm
The Alpha algorithm is a foundational method in process mining, used to construct process models from event logs. It is effective in identifying the sequence of activities but has limitations in uncovering deeper causal relationships.

### Causal Analysis Method
To address the limitations of the Alpha algorithm, this project integrates a causal analysis method based on the paper "Causal Reasoning over Control-Flow Decisions in Process Models" by Sander J.J. Leemans and Niek Tax. This method enhances process models by identifying and analyzing causal dependencies, allowing for better process optimization and decision-making.

## Reference
This project is based on the methodology described in the paper:

**Causal Reasoning over Control-Flow Decisions in Process Models**

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a method for causal analysis in process models, using event logs and process structures to derive causal relationships and dependencies.

## Conclusion
By integrating the Alpha algorithm with advanced causal analysis methods, this project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for business process modeling and optimization, offering deeper insights into the dynamics and dependencies of processes.
